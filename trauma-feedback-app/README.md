# Trauma Feedback App

This is a simple mobile app built with Expo/React Native. Trauma providers can scan the QR code in front of the trauma bay to check in and then submit feedback on the activation.

## Prerequisites

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- Install Expo CLI:

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```

- Install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the App

Start the development server:

```bash
expo start
```

Use the Expo Go app or an emulator to run the application on your device. Scanning the QR code will display a feedback form where providers can describe what worked or didn't work.
